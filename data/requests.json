    "name": "Family in Crisis: Help Sylvia and Vinicio",
    "description": "Earlier this month, Vinicio had a master calendar hearing where the judge scheduled a time to listen to arguments from the lawyer regarding granting Vinicio some kind of status that would allow him to remain in the US. Unfortunately he was not offered the opportunity for any kind of bond. The date for his next hearing was set all the way in December which means that by the time a judge finally hears arguments for Vinicio’s case, he will have been detained for nearly 6 months away from his family.\n\nWe are also rapidly approaching Silvia’s due date. We are hoping to throw her a baby shower in the coming final weeks of her pregnancy.",
